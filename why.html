    <h1>Why is Bridge for?</h1><br><br>
    <hr><br>
    <p>We<b><i style="color: rgb(250, 253, 90);">(Suresh and George)</i></b>  have created a unique people-first culture at MacAppStudio and hire without resumes or interviews because we have a stringent training process. Even though we sincerely wish to take all those who come in, unfortunately we cannot give the training or jobs to all because of the constraints we have on the office space and our projects.</p>
        <p>So we have decided to publish the same world class training program we give to our team, online also, so that anyone from any corner of Tamilnadu can learn the concepts, start programming, and fine-tune their skills to get a great job or start their own company.
      </p> <p>So instead of giving a fish (Job), we are trying to teach how to fish so that you can go ahead to get your fish (Job) anytime.</p>
